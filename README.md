go is Strongly Typed language which means that variable can have only single type string cannot be converted to int;

The package “main” tells the Go compiler that the package should compile as an executable program instead of a shared library. 

#Basic Data types available
bool string int int8 int16 int32 int64 uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64

byte(alias for uint8) rune(alias for int32) float32 float64 complex64 complex128
